# how to run the code
    Since some of the plug-ins used in this project is not very well surpported for the android platform / environment, therefore we currently are not able to run the project on android.

    # To run the code on IOS simulator:
      1. Have your environment setup according to React Native's official document: https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup
      2. Download the whole project as a zip, and then unzip it.
      3. In your terminal, navigate to that folder, you can either use commands or drag the folder directly to the terminal window.
      4. Run ` npm install ` to download all modules.
      5. When finished step 3, navigate to the ios folder under the project folder, run ` pod install `, waiting all packages to be installed, after it, don't forget to change the path back to your project's default path.
      6. In your terminal under your folder path, run ` npx react-native run-ios ` or ` yarn ios ` to run the project on the simulator, wait a moment, you should then see the project running on your simulator
